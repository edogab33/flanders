- OPT: 
- AGR: 

Bulyan and median win everywhere, avg resists in lie and agr. Flanders doesnt run well.

## b = 10

- No Attack: 
- Gaussian: 
- Lie: 
- OPT: 
- AGR: 

Same as before.

## b = 20

- No Attack: 
- Gaussian: 
- Lie: 
- OPT: 
- AGR: 

Same as before, but avg drops more than before in LIE.

## b = 30

- No Attack: 
- Gaussian: 
- Lie: 
- OPT: 
- AGR: 

Avg starts dropping more (but on AGR), Flanders performs well in AGR but worst than AVG and median.

## b = 40

- No Attack: 
- Gaussian: 
- Lie: 
- OPT: 
- AGR: 

Same as before.

## b = 50

- No Attack: flanders is comparable.
- Gaussian: flanders resists.
- Lie: everyone drops to 0, but flanders can resist more than anyone else.
- OPT: flanders resists up to the last round. All the other drop.
- AGR: avg is the best.

## b = 60
